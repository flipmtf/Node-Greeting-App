**Questions**

1. A node module is a set of functions to include in an application. Think of it as a JavaScript library. 

2. `module.exports` is available for reassignment. Any reassignment of `exports` will not be available outside of the module. 

3. Because `module.exports` is an empty object. So unless youâ€™re planning on the module being a specific object type, use `exports`.
